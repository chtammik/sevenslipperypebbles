# Seven Slippery Pebbles

This is an auditory memory game.

1) Choose an integer number X which defines the length of each round.

2) A player (player A) starts by choosing a number between 1 and X.
	
	> Player A could be the person that makes the radest sound effect in a test round, or anyone really.

3) That player then replaces their chosen integer with a description of a sound. 
	
	> It can be any sound.

4) The player left to the player A then starts the game by saying "one".

5) From there on the players continue to count upwards. 

6) Once the chosen integer number is reached, that player player B replaces it with an audible interpretation of the description.
	> The number that was replaced by that sound should be reflected in some form or fashion.
	
	> The sound can be produced with their mouth, a nearby object... etc.
	
	> Hilarity ensues.
	
	> If all players forget what sound should be made for that particular number the number is replaced with a reset sound.
	
	> If all sounds are reset sounds the game ends.

7) The counting continues until X is reached.

8) The player (player C) that X lands on creates a new description for a new sound, and assigns a number to it.

9) The player left to player C continues the counting once more.

10) The game advances in this fashion until 1 to X all have sounds assigned to them.
	
	> When this occurs, celebrate.

# Bonus Rules:	

	> Super Sound Designer Mode
		All sounds have to be recorded with a decent microphone.

	> Awesome Alliteration Mode
		The description may only contain words with the first letter of the number it is replacing.

	> Drinking Game (hard core) Mode
		When ever a player B forgets a sound, player B must drink. The game resets.

	> Assistance Mode
		Players may assist Player B to remember what the description was by gesturing, subtle hints or quoting the description.

	> Phase Cancellation Mode
		Player B may do a sound effect lesser times that the number it replaces by arguing that player B actually made the sound multiple times at once without phase cancellation.

	> DAW Mode
		sounds may/must be created using a digital audio workstation (REAPER, Audacity, Protools or any other).

This game is still in development.

The developers are not responsible for any damage that occurs as a result of playing this game.

Suggestions for improvement or additional rules are welcome.

Bug reports may be submitted to cristopher@tammik.ca.

There are plans to integrate digital technology to record, archive and share games played.

# App ideas:

	> Keeping track of numbers and the assigned descriptions
		may be hidden to enhance difficulty
	> A digital button that, while being pressed records the sound player B makes
		see whats-app messenger
		may also be used to record the description in step 2) and 6)
	> Storing all the permutations of a sound as reproduced by different players
		can be used in later designs
		best used in Super Sound Designer Mode
	> Sharing a game session for later analysis/nostalgic purposes
		This might include uploading a compilation of a game to some web service
		possibly in the format <desc><sound><desc><sound><sound><sound><desc><sound><sound> for a game where X=3
