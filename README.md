SPB - Seven Slippery Pebbles


This is an auditory memory game.

1) Choose an integer number X which defines the length of each round.

2) A player (player A) starts by choosing a number between 1 and X.
	
	> Player A could be the person that makes the radest sound effect in a test round, or anyone really.

3) That player then replaces their chosen integer with a description of a sound. 
	
	> It can be any sound.

- 4 The player left to the player A then starts the game by saying "one".

- From there on the players continue to count upwards. 

- 6) Once the chosen integer number is reached, that player player B replaces it with an audible interpretation of the description.
	> The number that was replaced by that sound should be reflected in some form or fashion.
	
	> The sound can be produced with their mouth, a nearby object... etc.
	
	> Hilarity ensues.
	
	> If all players forget what sound should be made for that particular number the number is replaced with a reset sound.
	
	> If all sounds are reset sounds the game ends.

- 7) The counting continues until X is reached.

- 8) The player (player C) that X lands on creates a new description for a new sound, and assigns a number to it.

- 9) The player left to player C continues the counting once more.

- 10) The game advances in this fashion until 1 to X all have sounds assigned to them.
	
	> When this occurs, celebrate.

Bonus Rules:	

	> Super Sound Designer Mode
		All sounds have to be recorded with a decent microphone.

	> Awesome Alliteration Mode
		The description may only contain words with the first letter of the number it is replacing.

	> Drinking Game (hard core) Mode
		When ever a player B forgets a sound, player B must drink. The game resets.

	> Assistance Mode
		Players may assist Player B to remember what the description was by gesturing, subtle hints or quoting the description.

	> Phase Cancellation Mode
		Player B may do a sound effect lesser times that the number it replaces by arguing that player B actually made the sound multiple times at once without phase cancellation.
